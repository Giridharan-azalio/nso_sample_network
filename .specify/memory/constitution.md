# Python Code Samples Network Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Standalone Sample Architecture
Every network automation example must be self-contained within its own directory, including:
- A descriptive `README.md` explaining the workflow, architecture, and prerequisites.
- A minimal `requirements.txt` listing direct dependencies.
- Clear, well-documented entry point scripts with minimal coupling to sibling samples.
- Shared logic (e.g., NSO client utilities, mock helpers) must remain well-factored and documented.

### II. Secrets & Security Hygiene (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Hardcoded credentials, API keys, private tokens, or device passwords MUST NEVER be committed to version control:
- Scripts MUST accept credentials from environment variables (`RESTCONF_HOST`, `RESTCONF_USER`, `RESTCONF_PASSWORD`, `NSO_HOST`, `DEVNET_RESTCONF_PASSWORD`, etc.) or prompt securely via `getpass()`.
- Default values must only point to public Cisco DevNet sandboxes with dummy credentials if required for local development.
- All secrets and credential files (`.env`, private keys) must be ignored via `.gitignore`.

### III. Repository Engineering Workflow (Clarify → Analyze → Plan & Test Payloads → Review → Human Sign-off → Implement)
When changes, features, or problem fixes are introduced, engineers and coding agents MUST follow this sequential lifecycle:
1. **Understand & Clarify**: The engineer/agent must understand the problem scope and ask up to 5 targeted clarification questions (`/speckit-clarify`) before writing specifications.
2. **Structure Specification & Acceptance Criteria**: Requirements and unambiguous acceptance criteria must be formally defined (`/speckit-specify` -> `spec.md`).
3. **Codebase Discovery & Analysis**: Before formulating technical changes, inspect the repository catalog (`PACKAGES.md`), analyze impacted sample directories, determine affected YANG models, controllers, and device targets (`/speckit-analyze`).
4. **Planning, Code Changes & Test Payload Generation**: Formulate the technical blueprint (`/speckit-plan` -> `plan.md`). This step MUST detail:
   - Planned code modifications and file diffs.
   - Network test strategy (offline mocks vs DevNet sandbox).
   - Generated network test payloads (exact RESTCONF JSON/YANG payloads, NETCONF XML filters, or CLI commands).
5. **Impact Review & Checkpoint**: Review all impacted components, blast radius, and test payloads.
6. **Human Approval Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: The human engineer must review and approve the planned changes, test payloads, and rollback safety before task execution begins.
7. **Task Decomposition & Implementation**: Deconstruct into granular tasks (`/speckit-tasks` -> `tasks.md`) and execute iteratively against offline mock tests (`/speckit-implement`, `/speckit-converge`).

### IV. Deterministic Network I/O & Resilient Error Handling
Network automation interacts with real devices, controllers (Cisco NSO, APIC-EM), and sandboxes that can experience latency, transient connectivity loss, or session aborts:
- Every network request (RESTCONF HTTP, NETCONF RPC, SSH Netmiko) MUST define explicit timeouts.
- Scripts must handle HTTP error codes (`raise_for_status()`) and network exceptions gracefully, reporting meaningful messages to `stderr` and returning standard non-zero exit codes.
- Responses should default to structured output (JSON/YANG data) or clean console output; avoid unparsed tracebacks and noisy logs.

### V. Test-First & Smoke Verification Gates
Reliability across varied network environments requires multi-tiered verification:
- **Unit & Mock Tests**: New automation logic, scenario handlers, and API wrappers must include automated mock/offline unit tests (using `pytest` or `unittest` with mock responses) runnable without active network access.
- **Integration & Smoke Tests**: Where DevNet sandboxes are available, live smoke verification should validate device reachability and payload compatibility before release.
- **Static Quality**: Scripts must pass code quality checks (`ruff check .`, `mypy --ignore-missing-imports`).

### VI. Multi-Platform Network Topology & Protocol Alignment Constraints
To ensure automated configuration succeeds across heterogeneous hardware and virtual appliances in the Cisco DevNet Sandbox topology:
- **Strict Management Protocol Partitioning**:
  - Devices `10.10.20.171` (`edge-firewall01`), `10.10.20.172` (`edge-sw01`), `10.10.20.173` (`core-rtr01`), and `10.10.20.174` (`dev-core-rtr01`) are **Telnet** devices operating strictly on port **23**.
  - Devices `10.10.20.175` (`dist-rtr01`), `10.10.20.176` (`dev-dist-rtr01`), `10.10.20.177` (`dist-sw01`), `10.10.20.178` (`dev-dist-sw01`), and `10.10.20.181` (`internet-rtr01`) are **SSH** devices operating strictly on port **22**.
  - Automation scripts and NSO CDB device configurations MUST respect this division. Connecting over SSH to telnet-only endpoints or Telnet to SSH-only endpoints is strictly prohibited.
- **SSH Key Onboarding & Sync-From Prerequisite**:
  - Before performing any transactional configuration commits across SSH-managed devices, SSH host keys must be fetched (`fetch-ssh-host-keys` / `fetch_host_keys`).
  - Fleet-wide state synchronization (`sync-from`) must be verified to ensure devices are `in-sync` in NSO CDB before executing mutation payloads.
- **Multi-NED YANG Data Model Compatibility**:
  - Code provisioning interfaces, loopbacks, or ACLs must branch based on the device's Network Element Driver (NED):
    - **Cisco IOS-XE** (`cisco-ios-cli-6.109`): Interface `tailf-ned-cisco-ios:interface/Loopback={id}`, IP `primary.address` and `mask`. Extended ACLs use `tailf-ned-cisco-ios:ip/access-list/extended/ext-named-acl={name}` with `ext-access-list-rule`.
    - **Cisco IOS-XR** (`cisco-iosxr-cli-7.65`): Interface `tailf-ned-cisco-ios-xr:interface/Loopback={id}`, IP `ipv4.address.ip` and `mask`.
    - **Cisco NX-OS** (`cisco-nx-cli-5.27`): Interface `tailf-ned-cisco-nx:interface/loopback={id}` (lowercase), IP `ipaddr` formatted in CIDR notation (e.g. `172.16.2.1/32`).
    - **Cisco ASA** (`cisco-asa-cli-6.18`): Adaptive Security Appliance CLI data models.
- **Management Interface Protection Guardrail**:
  - Never apply traffic-filtering ACLs, port-blocking policies, or administrative `shutdown` commands to out-of-band management interfaces (e.g. `GigabitEthernet1` on `dist-rtr01` at `10.10.20.175`). All security enforcement and interface isolation tests must target dedicated test interfaces or transit links.

## Technology Standards & Tooling

### Python Runtime & Environment
- Target Python version: Python 3.9+ (Python 3.12/3.14 compatible).
- Package management: `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for modern workspace workflows, with per-folder `requirements.txt` for standalone portability.
- Primary network libraries: `requests` for RESTCONF, `ncclient` for NETCONF, `netmiko` for CLI automation, `pysnmp` for SNMP operations.

### API & Protocol Conventions
- **RESTCONF**: RFC 8040 standard endpoints with `application/yang-data+json` media types. Support both direct Cisco IOS-XE native models and Cisco NSO device hierarchy (`/restconf/data/tailf-ncs:devices/device={device}/config`).
- **NETCONF**: RFC 6241 operations (`get-config`, `edit-config`, `copy-config`) with valid XML/YANG filter specifications.
- **CLI / SSH**: Netmiko handlers with robust prompt detection and config session rollback where supported.

## Development Workflow & Contribution Governance

### Contribution Conventions
- **PR Title Format**: `[sample-folder] <Short description>` (e.g., `[NC-get-config] support NSO device targeting`).
- **Scope**: Keep changes localized to the relevant sample directory or core module.
- **Review Gates**:
  1. Offline unit/mock tests pass.
  2. Static lint checks pass (`ruff check .`).
  3. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive tokens introduced.
  4. Updated documentation in the sample's `README.md` and repository `PACKAGES.md`.

### Constitution Governance
- This constitution supersedes all informal development practices.
- Proposed modifications require:
  1. Documentation of the rationale and architectural impact.
  2. Semantic version bump:
     - **MAJOR**: Incompatible governance overhaul or principle removal.
     - **MINOR**: New principle, technological constraint, or expanded workflow gate.
     - **PATCH**: Clarifications, formatting, and non-semantic refinements.
  3. Amendment logging in the project history.

**Version**: 1.2.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-11-02 | **Last Amended**: 2026-11-03
